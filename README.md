PIC16F54 Emulator (for the PIC32)
=================================

This is a simple Instruction Cycle emulator for the PIC16F54 (baseline) architecture.

* For debugging purposes, logging is provided on a serial port (UART1)
* Stricter - Timing can be enabled to limit execution speed to Tcy provided by TMR1
* No attempt was made at optimising the code execution
* Testing of correct instruction execution has been extremely limited (see .ROM binary file - edit using any text editor)
